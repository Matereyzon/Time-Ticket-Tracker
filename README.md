# Time & Ticket Tracker

A minimal offline Windows app to track work time and completed tickets.

## Why this exists

I work in IT and got tired of time tracking tools that require:
- accounts
- cloud sync
- dashboards I never look at
- productivity gimmicks

I just wanted something simple:
- press start
- do the work
- stop when done
- count tickets

Nothing more.

So I built this small desktop app for myself.

## What it does

- Track work time (start / stop / reset)
- Manually count completed tickets
- Works completely offline
- No accounts
- No cloud
- No notifications
- Can be launched at Windows startup

## What it does NOT do (by design)

- No synchronization
- No statistics or reports
- No historical analytics
- No productivity gamification

The goal is zero friction.

## Who this is for

- IT technicians
- Sysadmins
- Technical freelancers
- Anyone who wants a tool that stays out of the way

## Platform

- Windows 10+

## Download

The app is distributed as a compiled Windows executable.

## Notes

This is a small personal tool, not a SaaS.
Feedback is welcome if you feel something obvious is missing.
